# CalCount

## A personal calorie counter

**What will the application do?** <br>
This application will allow users to keep track 
of their daily calorie consumption. In addition to the main functionality
of CalCount, the application will have the following features: 
- In addition to calories, macronutrients and exercise can also be tracked. 
- Individualized calorie recommendations based on age, sex, and 
weight, and goal (i.e lose weight, gain weight, maintain weight). 
- Users will be able to set their own goals in regard to their daily calorie, 
macronutrient, and exercise needs. 
- Daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of calorie consumption/usage.

**Who will use it?** <br>
This application can be used by any individual who is 18-years 
or older. As this app gives personalized recommendations for user 
calorie needs, it is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age.
CalCount can be used by a variety of individuals for a multitude of 
different purposes. The primary user-base of CalCount will be individuals
who are trying to gain weight, lose weight, or maintain weight. It can also
be used by individuals who wish to keep track of their daily macronutrient
consumption or exercise levels. 

**Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
This project is of interest to me as more and more people are starting to 
keep track of their daily calorie consumption and usage. Calorie-counting apps
have become an important part of the lives of individuals who are trying to either 
change their weight or become a healthier person in general.
